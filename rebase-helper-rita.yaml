    Each action should be logged and visible by user.

    - extract tarball with the existing sources to directory old_sources/
        - extract tarball with the new sources to directory new_sources/
        - Provide a list of patches mentioned in SPEC file
        - New spec file is stored in results/
    - for all patches
        - apply all patches with git command to old_sources/ directory
        - add new_sources to old_sources/ with command git rebase --onto new_sources
        - solve all conflicts which arrise during the git rebase
    - create srpm from old and new spec files & new sources & patches (Builder)
    - rebuild srpm -> RPMs (Builder)
    - Run rpmdiff tool for finding libraries and header changes.
    - Inform user what libraries and header files were changed.
