## Rebase-helper workflow

This tool helps you to rebase package to the latest version

How the rebase-helper works:
- Each action should be logged and visible by user.
    - extract tarball with the existing sources to directory old_sources/<package_name>
    - extract tarball with the new sources to directory new_sources/<package_name>
    - Provide a list of patches mentioned in SPEC file
    - New spec file is stored in results/
- for all patches
    - apply all patches with git command to old_sources/<package_name> directory
    - add new_sources<package_name> to old_sources/<package_name> 
        with command git rebase --onto new_sources <inital_commit> <last_commit>
    - solve all conflicts which arrise during the git rebase
- create srpm from old and new spec files & new sources & patches (Builder)
- rebuild srpm -> RPMs (Builder)
- Run rpmdiff tool for finding libraries and header changes.
- Inform user what libraries and header files were changed.
