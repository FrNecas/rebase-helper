Prerequisite is to copy a new upstream release to a GIT repository of relevant package.

How Rebase-Helper should work.
- extract tarball with the existing sources to directory <package_name>
- extract tarball with the new sources to directory <package_name>-rebasehelper
- apply first patch to existing directory <package_name>
- Try to apply a patch to <package_name>-rebasehelper
- If the patch passed go to another if not try to apply them via fuzz
- If the patch failed run a DiffHelper to correct a patch.
- Save the corrected patch to <org_name>-rebase.patch
- Go through all patche
- Run rpmdiff tool for finding libraries and header changes.

What is currently missing:
- PatchHelper class - abstract class with at least one Patch Helper (mostly patch command)
- DiffHelper class - abstract class with at least one Diff Helper (like vimdiff, Meld)
    - Each DiffHelper class can have different syntax
